# Main
In the directory CALEB_CURRY, I've started assembling an app called App.cpp.
*Executable 'App'

    []# Language: C++
    []# Path: /workspace/CALEB_CURRY/App.cpp

# App.cpp
This App.cpp file is the main file for my program.
Essentially, I want to create a number of projects,
each to challenge myself with programming in C++.

I want to create a number of projects, I just haven't
yet come up with all of them.

So far, I've created a Menu system for navigating the
application along with a game called Guessing Game.

I might incorporate my previous project from my 
deprecated mdy.cpp file. I also need to finish that
project. It still only counts to numbers in the future.
